Hi, I'm Jo√£o! I'm a game developer born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal, and welcome to my space on the web.

I've always been a gamer, my earliest memories being with a Playstation 2 and my cousin's Game Boy Color. I honestly can't remember a time when I did not have a video game to play, even if it was on an old computer with a CRT monitor. When I learned about the concept of a "dream job", and that I had to work if I wanted to have a nice life, I decided it would be making games (and archaeology but let's ignore that for now).

Instead of studying what I was supposed to during school, I spent my time copy-pasting JavaScript into Unity, back when it was supported. That eventually led me to the path of programming which led me to where I am now: a part-time game developer and full-time procrastinator.

Here you'll find tutorials, projects, photos, my opinions and whatever else I feel like writing about. My goal with this website is to share what I learn with everyone, even if there's not much to learn from here.
