Welcome to my first ever article!

Having my own little space on the internet has always been a project of mine. In previous iterations, it has been a simple WordPress website where I showcased my below-average photos. This time around, I decided that I wanted to make everything from scratch instead of relying on a clunky content manager. With this approach, I'm not only in full control of my website (for better or worse), but I can also keep my web development skills from getting rusty.

As my friends know, my design skills do not exist. That's why I took inspiration (which is programmer-speak to say copy pasted) from [the wonderful design Tania has made on her website](https://www.taniarascia.com/). It was only possible due to Tania's website being open source, which is why I think it's only fair for me to pay the favour forward. To honour the "open source pact", all the source code for this website is available on [my Github](https://github.com/joaofonsecadev/gatsby-personal-website).

Don't be mistaken though, the website is far from being done. There are still a lot of improvements I want to make. Some of them are:

- Proper SEO
- Custom icons
- Images in articles
- RSS feed

And this concludes this short introduction to my blog. Thank you for taking the time to read this first article, and I promise that when you come back there will be more content!
